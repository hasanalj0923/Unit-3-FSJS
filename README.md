# Interactive Form Project

## Overview

This project enhances a basic form with interactive features and validation using JavaScript. The form dynamically updates based on user input and selections, improving the overall user experience.

### Extra Features

- When selecting an activity, any conflicting activity is automatically disabled to prevent scheduling overlaps.
- Real-time validation for the credit card input:
  - Shows a message if fewer than 13 digits are entered.
  - Alerts if more than 16 digits are typed.
  - If the input is the right length but not only digits, a warning appears.
  - The input field is visually marked as valid when the input meets all requirements.
