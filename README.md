# Interactive Form

## Overview

This project adds interactive behavior and validation to a registration form using JavaScript. It responds to user input and adjusts the form based on what the user selects, helping to prevent errors and guide the user smoothly.

## Features (Exceeds Expectations)

- **Conflicting Activities Disabled:** If a user selects an activity that overlaps with another, the conflicting option becomes unavailable.
- **Credit Card Input Feedback:**
  - Shows a message if the number is under 13 digits: "Card number must be at least 13 digits."
  - Shows a message if over 16 digits: "Card number must be no more than 16 digits."
  - If the length is okay but contains non-digits, the message will say it must be 13–16 digits only.
  - When the number is valid, a green border (valid class) appears while typing.
